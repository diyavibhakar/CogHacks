<h1>Deductive Reasoning Questions</h1>
<h2>Question 3</h2>
<h4>Three friends are training to run a marathon. Part of this training involves running steadily round a track in the local park. They are all at different stages in their training schedules so they run at different speeds. Alec completes each lap in 3 minutes, Barry takes 5 minutes and Colin takes 6 minutes. They all leave the start line at the same time. If they each maintain their running speed throughout the session, how many more laps will Alec have completed compared to Barry when the three of them next cross the start line together?
